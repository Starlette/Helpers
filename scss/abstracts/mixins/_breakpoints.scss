 * 
 * How to use:
 * --- @include breakpoint(sm);
 * --- @include breakpoint(sm, max);
 * --- @include breakpoint(600px, max);
 * 
 * $breakpoint options:
 * --- xs
 * --- sm
 * --- md
 * --- lg
 * --- xl
 * --- xxl
 * --- 600px
 * 
 * $direction options: 
 * --- min
 * --- max
 * --- between
 * 
 * $direction "between": 
 * If you use this with (example) $breakpoint "md" then it will use "md" as the min width and "lg" (next breakpoint) as the max width.
